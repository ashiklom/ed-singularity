# be used instead of ubuntu:trusty

# AFAIK, all of the blocks below use `sh` shell, NOT bash, 
# so make sure the commands are POSIX-compliant

# This block is run on the host (not the image), before the 
# image is built

# Docker, this entire block is run every time `bootstrap` is 
# called. However, because it runs on an existing image 
# (like a VM), commands like `apt-get install` will not take 
# long the second time since the packages are already 
# installed.
